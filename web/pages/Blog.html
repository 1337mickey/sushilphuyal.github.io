But major ones of them can be communication technology, medical technology, construction technology, architecture technology, information technology, etc. </p><br>

Enabling us to do more household chores than before that there are neither machines nor appliances.  There is no doubt that the main items in our house today were automated, which makes our life easy, organized, simple, and most especially much safer. While some forms of technology may have made positive changes in the world, there is evidence for the harmful effects of technology and its overuse. Social media and mobile devices may lead to psychological and physical issues, such as eyestrain and difficulty focusing on essential tasks. They may also contribute to more severe health conditions, such as depression. The overuse of technology may have a more significant impact on developing children and teenagers. In this article, learn about the psychological and physical health effects of technology, as well as how to create healthful habits with technology and avoid overuse.</p><br>
